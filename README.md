# ElevatorSim-C#
Elevator Simulation designed in C-Sharp Programming:

This project was designed for fun, it is an elevator simulation written in C-sharp Programming language.
The Elevator contains a single lift cabin that travels to two floor only, up or down, when a call button is pressed.
On arrival to the call floor the doors will automatically slide open for people to come out, or go in.
The elevator uses Microsoft Access database to store the lift cabin locations. 
The purpose of this project is to inform few junior developers that C-Sharp is a good and low cost tool for simulation.
